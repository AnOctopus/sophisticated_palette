# Streamlit App Testing Framework

**Welcome to the Streamlit app testing framework quickstart!** These instructions are optimized
for users who have opened this repo in Github Codespaces as a quickstart view. Follow the instructions
below to get a quick overview of the new framework.

## Instructions

1. A few seconds after opening the codespace, you should see the Sophisticated Palette app open in a tab to the right of these instructions.
1. Click around the app to get familiar with the functionality.
1. For a closer look, view the app source code in `app.py`. It should be available in a tab next to this one.
1. This app has tests implemented in `test_app.py`. Review the tests to see examples of the testing framework in action.
1. Finally, you should see a terminal open below these instructions. Click into the terminal and enter `pytest -vv` to execute the tests.
1. Try editing the tests or editing the app to see failures, additional previews, or you can add your own tests.

## Next steps

Hopefully this is a helpful overview of the feature! View the [full README](./README.md) for links to further documentation,
examples of setting up tests in CI, and link to install the test framework in your own app. We also have links to provide
feedback on the test framework so we can improve it. Thank you!
