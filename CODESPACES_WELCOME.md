# Streamlit App Testing Framework

**Welcome to the Streamlit app testing framework quickstart!** These instructions are optimized
for users who have opened this repo in Github Codespaces as a quickstart view. Follow the instructions
below to get a quick overview of the new framework.

## Instructions

1. A few seconds after opening the codespace, you should see the Sophisticated Palette app open
  in a tab to the right of these instructions. You can click around the app to get familiar with
  the functionality.
1. For a closer look, view the app source code in `app.py`. It should be available in a tab next to this one.
1. This app has tests implemented in `test_app.py`. You can review the tests to understand how the testing
  framework works, and which capabilities we can test with this app.
1. Finally, you should see a terminal open below these instructions. Type `pytest` and hit enter to execute
  the tests. They should complete in a few seconds! For more details, you can run `pytest -vv`.
1. Try editing the tests or editing the app to see failures, additional previews, or you can add your own tests.

## Next steps

Hopefully this is a helpful overview of the feature! View the [full README](./README.md) for links to further documentation,
examples of setting up tests in CI, and link to install the test framework in your own app. We also have links to provide
feedback on the test framework so we can improve it. Thank you!
