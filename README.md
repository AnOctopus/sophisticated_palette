# Streamlit App Testing Demo

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/AnOctopus/st-testing-demo?quickstart=1)

This repo demonstrates the capabilities and usage of Streamlit's new `AppTest` class, **released in Streamlit 1.28**.
App testing enables developers to:

- Run your app as a headless script
- Inspect and make assertions about the output content via the DOM in object-attribute style
- Programmatically modify the input values on various widgets, re-run the app, and inspect the output

`AppTest` works well with [unittest.TestCase](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#test-cases)
and [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.3.x/) or similar tools. The testing framework ships with
core Streamlit (and in fact is used heavily in Streamlit's internal unit testing) -
the functionality shown here can be installed from the provided whl.

The example is built on the existing [sophisticated_palette app](https://github.com/syasini/sophisticated_palette)
originally built by @syasini and hosted on Streamlit Community Cloud: https://sophisticated-palette.streamlit.app/

## A simple example

A simple example that demonstrates the anatomy of a unit test and the key features of the unit testing framework

```python
import unittest
from streamlit.testing.v1 import AppTest

class TestSuite(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_sidebar(self):
        """Simple test of the sidebar controlling the palettes rendered"""

        # Load and run the script from a file path
        at = AppTest.from_file("app.py").run()

        # No exceptions were rendered in the app output
        assert not at.exception

        # Five color pickers are rendered on the first run
        assert len(at.color_picker) == 5

        # You can also query a widget by key to modify it or check the value
        assert at.number_input(key="sample_size").value == 500

        # Set the value of the first number input in the sidebar
        # (palette size) to 2, and re-run the app
        at.sidebar.number_input[0].set_value(2).run()

        # Two color pickers are rendered in the second run
        assert len(at.color_picker) == 2
```

See `test_app.py` for the tests and some further explanation.

## Run it using GitHub Codespaces

You can get started very quickly by [launching this repo in GitHub Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/AnOctopus/st-testing-demo?quickstart=1). The app and [Codespaces walkthrough](./CODESPACES_WELCOME.md) should load automatically after a few seconds.

## Run it locally

I recommend installing to a venv and then running the test suite with pytest.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AnOctopus/st-testing-demo.git
cd st-testing-demo
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest
```

## Using it with CI

The testing framework just uses pytest, so any CI tools that work with python should just work. You can see
a Github Action workflow in this repo that runs the tests using
[GitHub's python starter workflow](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/main/ci/python-app.yml)
with zero modifications, and it works great.

You can view the [Github Actions configuration for this repository](https://github.com/AnOctopus/st-testing-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/python-app.yml#L37-L39),
and [recent CI runs including the test execution](https://github.com/AnOctopus/st-testing-demo/actions/workflows/python-app.yml).
