# About tests in this repo

This app fork is being used to demonstrate testing using Streamlit's new testing framework.

I recommend installing to a venv and then running the test suite with pytest.
```
$ python -m venv .venv
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ pytest
```

See `test_app.py` for the tests and some explanation.
